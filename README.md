### Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated and skilled data engineer with 4+ years of experience in handling large datasets. I specialize in designing and creating data pipelines, and I am highly proficient in data mining, mathematics, and statistical analysis.

My expertise lies in developing high-velocity, high-volume stream processing pipelines using technologies such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Hive, and Airflow. I also have experience in ingesting data from RDBMS to Hive tables using SQOOP.

I love to use my programming skills in Python and SQL to analyze large amounts of data to uncover trends and patterns, build predictive models and machine-learning algorithms, and propose solutions to business challenges. I enjoy using data visualization techniques to present information in a clear and concise manner.

I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with engineering and development teams to find the best solutions for our clients. If you're interested in learning more about my work and experience, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
